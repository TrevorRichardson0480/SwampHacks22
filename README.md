Voice Assistant Article Summarizer Voice assistant that summarizes articles based on questions you ask. Example: "why is the sky blue?" It will find the "best" article and summarize the main points to give an answer instead of just directing me to open the webpage myself (like Siri does). This is not as hard as it seems because we would utilize someone else’s summarizing model.  Tech: Probably in the form of a mobile app, so React Native. The summarizer model could be GPT-3 which is incredibly good and cool, I encourage you guys to look it up if you haven’t heard of it. It can do so many things, including summarizing texts concisely. GPT-3 part would probably be in Python, but maybe can be done in JavaScript.
